# Grextor

Grextor is a proof-of-concept engine that combines vector similarity search
with graph traversal to retrieve semantically relevant and structurally valid
information.

## Why Grextor?

Vector search answers:
- "What is similar?"

Graph search answers:
- "What is connected, allowed, or dependent?"

Grextor answers both.

## Core Idea

1. Embed documents into vectors
2. Store relationships in a graph
3. Query by meaning
4. Constrain by structure

## Use Cases

- Knowledge base search with access control
- Code intelligence with dependency awareness
- Recommendation systems with business rules
- Trust-based discovery systems

## Status

Experimental PoC. Not production-ready.
